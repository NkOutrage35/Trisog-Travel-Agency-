Airlines grounded fleets, hotels shuttered their doors, and popular destinations became ghost towns overnight. The industry faced losses exceeding $4 trillion, making this the worst crisis in tourism history.</p><p>Border closures and travel restrictions created a domino effect across the entire tourism ecosystem. From tour operators to local artisans dependent on tourist spending, millions of livelihoods were threatened. The sudden halt in international mobility revealed both the fragility and interconnectedness of global tourism networks.</p><p>As countries implemented varying levels of restrictions, domestic tourism emerged as a temporary lifeline for many businesses. However, this shift couldn't compensate for the loss of international visitors in destinations heavily reliant on foreign tourism revenue.</p><p>The pandemic forced a fundamental rethinking of tourism models and highlighted the need for more resilient and sustainable approaches to travel and hospitality management.</p>",
